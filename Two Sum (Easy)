1. Two Sum (Easy)
https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1]


Code:
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        
        num_dict = {}
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            num_dict[nums[i]] = i
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            num = target - nums[i]
            if num in num_dict and num_dict[num] != i:
                return [i, num_dict[num]]
              
 Complexity:
  Space: O(n)
  Time: O(n)
